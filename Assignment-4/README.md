# Data Visualization - AWS

It is difficult to find meaning in large volumes of “textual” output, most users
prefer pictures: graphs, pie charts, etc.
Various mechanisms for visualizing data within a browser, which are “light weight”
and require no plugins, or additional (local) downloads support showing results
which are easy to read and understand.
(Free) supporting tools and libraries include:
Javascript:
d3js.org
InfoVis: philogb.github.io/jit/demos.html
js.cytoscape.org
Other:
developers.google.com/chart/
www.highcharts.com (HTML5)
Your assignment is to visualize and display the results from your previous assignment
within a browser, allow a user to select intervals or attributes in a data set, show
results as a pie chart, a histogram, or a scatter or point chart (possibly connected:
a line).
Using those SQL tables to do queries, rather than display the results as text,
display as an image (a picture).
Users of this service will interact with your service through web page
interfaces, all processing and web service hosting is (of course) cloud based.
